Triangle growing downwards
Basic
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/triangle-growing-downwards2344/1/

Given string str of a constant length, print a triangle out of it. The triangle
should start with the first character of the string and keep growing downwards
by adding one character from the string.

The spaces on the left side of the triangle should be replaced with a dot character. 

Example 1:

Input:
str = "geeks"

Output:
....g
...ge
..gee
.geek
geeks

Example 2:

Input:
str = "thisi"

Output:
....t
...th
..thi
.this
thisi

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function
printTriangleDownwards() which takes the string str as an input parameter and
prints the required triangle.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*N), Where N is the size of input string.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= |str| <= 500
