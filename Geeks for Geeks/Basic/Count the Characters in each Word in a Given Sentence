"""
Count the characters in each word in a given sentence
Basic
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-the-characters-in-each-word-in-a-given-sentence3451/1/ 

Given a string containing multiple words, count the characters in each word and display them.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "the quick brown fox"
Output: 3 5 5 3
Explanation: "the" has 3 characters
"quick" has 5 characters
"brown" has 5 characters
"fox" has 3 characters

Example 2:

Input: 
S = "geeks for geeks"
Output: 5 3 5
Explanation: "geeks" has 5 characters
"for" has 3 characters
"geeks" has 5 characters

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
function countChars() which takes the string S as inputs are returns an array
containing the number of characters in each word of the string in the order as
they appear in the input string S.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|) (for output).


Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 105

        for word in s.split():
            result.append(len(word))

        return result
