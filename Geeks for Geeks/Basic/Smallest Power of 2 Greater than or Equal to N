https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-power-of-2-greater-than-or-equal-to-n2630/0/ 

Given a number N.Find the nearest number which is a power of 2 and greater than or equal to N.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 1
Output:
1
Explanation:
The nearest power of 2 greater than or 
equal to 1 is 2^0=1.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
8
Explanation:
The nearest power of 2 greater than 5 is 
2^3=8.


Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your Task is to complete the
function nearestPowerOf2() which takes a number N as input parameter and returns
the nearest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to N.

Expected Time Complexity:O(LogN)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=N<=1018
