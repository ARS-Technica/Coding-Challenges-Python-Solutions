Given an array of N integers. Find the first element that occurs atleast K number of times.
 

Example 1:

Input :
N = 7, K = 2
A[] = {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}
Output : 4
Explanation:
Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. 
But 4 is first that occurs 2 times.


Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the 
function firstElementKTime() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer 
K as inputs and returns the required answer. If answer is not present in the array, return -1.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 <= N, K <= 105
1<= A <= 106

class Solution:
    def firstElementKTime(a, n, k):
        frequency = {}

        # More efficent than adding conditional to creation of new dict key
        if k == 1: return a[0]

        for idx in range(n):
            if a[idx] in frequency.keys():
                frequency[a[idx]] += 1
                if frequency[a[idx]] == k:
                    return a[idx]
            else:
                frequency[a[idx]] = 1

        return -1
