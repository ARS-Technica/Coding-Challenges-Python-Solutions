Rearrange the array

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rearrange-the-array5802/1/?page=1&difficulty[]=-1&category[]=Arrays&sortBy=accuracy 

Given an array arr of n integers, task is to print the array in the order â€“
smallest number, largest number, 2nd smallest number, 2nd largest number, 3rd
smallest number, 3rd largest number and so on.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 9
arr[] = {1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5}
Output: 1 9 2 8 3 7 4 6 5
Explanation:
Smallest number is 1. Largest number is 9. 
2nd smallest number is 2. Then 2nd largest
number is 8. And so on.

Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1 4 2 3
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
function rearrangeArray() which takes the array of integers arr and n as
parameters and returns void. You need to change the array itself.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints: 
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <=106
