"""
Last index of a character in the string
Basic
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/last-index-of-a-character-in-the-string4516/1/

Given a string S  and a character X, the task is to find the last index (0 based indexing)
of X in string S. If no index found then the answer will be -1.


Example 1:

Input: S = "Geeks", P = 'e'
Output: 2
Explanation: Last index of 'e' 
is 2.

Example 2:

Input: S = "okiyh", P = 'z'
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no character
as 'z'.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function LastIndex()
which takes the string s and character p as inputs and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
S and P contain only lower and upper case alphabets.
