You are given an array arr[] of size N.
The array consists of a permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, … , N} for some
positive integer N. You have to start at the position which has 1 in the array
and then travel to the position which has 2. Then from 2, you travel to 3 and
so on till you reach the position which has N.

When you travel from Arr[i] to Arr[j], the distance travelled is | i– j |.
Find the total distance you have to travel to reach N when you start from 1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
