Easy
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-subset-with-greater-sum/1 

You are given an array Arr of size N containing non-negative integers. Your 
task is to choose the minimum number of elements such that their sum should be 
greater than the sum of the rest of the elements of the array.
