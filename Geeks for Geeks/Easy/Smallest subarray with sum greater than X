Smallest subarray with sum greater than X
Easy
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-subarray-with-sum-greater-than-x5651/1 

Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray
with sum greater than the given value.

Note: The answer always exists. It is guaranteed that x doesn't exceed the
summation of a[i] (from 1 to N).

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
function smallestSubWithSum() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer
X as inputs and returns the required ouput.
