Common Subsequence
Easy
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/common-subsequence4049/1/

Given two strings a and b. Check whether they contain any common subsequence (non empty) or not.

Example 1:

Input:
a = "ABEF" b = "CADE"
Output: 1
Explanation: Subsequence "AE" occurs
in both the strings.

Example 2:

Input: 
a = "ABCD", b = "EFGH"
Output: 0
Explanation: There's no common subsequence
in both the strings.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
function commonSubseq() which takes the string a and string b as inputs and
returns true if there's a common subsequence in both the strings. Else, it
returns false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|a| + |b|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
2 <= |a|, |b| <=105
