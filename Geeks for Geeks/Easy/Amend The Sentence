Amend The Sentence
Easy
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/amend-the-sentence3235/1/

Given a string which is basically a sentence without spaces between words.
However the first letter of every word is in uppercase. You need to print this
sentence after following amendments:

(i) Put a single space between these words
(ii) Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.
Note: The first character of the string can be both uppercase/lowercase.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "BruceWayneIsBatman"
Output: bruce wayne is batman
Explanation: The words in the string are
"Bruce", "Wayne", "Is", "Batman".

Example 2:

Input: 
s = "You"
Output: you
Explanation: The only word in the string
is "You".

Your Task: 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
function amendSentence() which takes the string s as input and returns a string
with the stated amendments.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (for output string).


Constraints:
1<=Size of String <=106
